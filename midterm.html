    <p>Over the course of 4 years, Matthew "MATEOjr" Redzinski has helped dozens of struggling Smash players and Twitch streamers capture their vision (when he feels like it). If you've ever seen a flashy tournament advertisement, or eSports org roster, chances are it was not designed by MATEOjr, but like there's a pretty low chance that it actually was which is pretty cool kinda.</p>

    <p>MATEOjr has worked with the following content  creators and organizations:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NairoMK</strong></li>
            <li>Down B Queens</li>
            <li>Several Presidents</li>
            <li><strong>God that one time</strong></li>
            <li><strong>OJ</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>But that's not all.</h2>
    <p>MATEOjr is an (in)experienced web page designer. His services are just a click away. Did you know that he developed these websites?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.YouTube.com">YouTube</a></strong></li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.BarackObama.com">BarackObama.com</a></strong></li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com">LeagueOfLegends.com</a></strong></li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.scientology.org/">Scientology.org</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Not convinced?</h2>
    <p>These customer reviews speak for themselves.</p>
    
        <p><emphasis><strong>Edward Gluteus [⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐]</strong>I asked MATEOjr to make an elaborate, multi-media collage of all my favorite fighting game characters to use as a YouTube thumbnail, and he finished it in only 11 hours! Best $5 I've ever spent.</emphasis></p>
        <p><emphasis><strong>Roderik Steinhaus [⭐⭐⭐⭐]</strong>He's pretty godlike at making Twitch layouts. It almost makes me want to pay him but nah. He's getting scammed lol</emphasis></p>
        <p><emphasis><strong>Nairoby Emkay [⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐]</strong>Really good advertisements, also I'm bald!</emphasis></p>
